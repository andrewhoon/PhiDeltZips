This is a website I am designing for my friends and I. We have a fantasy football league that we have been a part of for years.
This site is to store our past stats and data in the event we switch providers.  I also have loaded a forum APT into the site
so that we can have a new way to communicate and store our coversations.  I would like to add player bios and eventually host a 
podcast from the site.  This is meant to be fun.
